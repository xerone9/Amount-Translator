Download and install the application. Create an excel file having values you want to translate in first column. Make sure the sheet name is Sheet1 (which is the default name of the sheet of new excel file created). Make sure the values entered in the column contains no formula and the values are in number form not text form and there will be no floats (Decimal Values) but only numbers
Double Click on the executable file and add that excel file in the software and click translate. It will automatically add the translated values on the very next cell of the values entered.
